# Open Hours #

**Open Hours** are times when the space is open to the public.  The **Manager** is responsible for the space and is in charge of keeping the space clean and safe.  The space should never be left open without an active **Manager**.

## Manager  ##

Whoever unlocks and opens the door to the public is the **Manager**.  The **Manager** must ensure that users of the space have signed a liability waiver, help keep the space clean and safe, and oversee the general operations of the space.

If the **Manager** must leave the space at any time, the **Manager** must either pass the manager role to another person who is capable of holding **Open Hours** or ask everyone to leave the space.  _At no time may people be in the space without an active **Manager** overseeing operations._

## Expelling people from the space ##

If the **Manager** feels that any person is acting in an unsafe or unrespectable way, the **Manager** may ask that person to leave.  Access to the space and its resources is contigent on the approval of the active **Manager**.

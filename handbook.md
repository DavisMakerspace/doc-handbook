# Open Hours #

**Open Hours** are times when the space is open to the public.  The **Manager** is responsible for the space and is in charge of keeping the space clean and safe.  The space should never be left open without an active **Manager**.

## Manager  ##

Whoever unlocks and opens the door to the public is the **Manager**.  The **Manager** must ensure that users of the space have signed a liability waiver, help keep the space clean and safe, and oversee the general operations of the space.

If the **Manager** must leave the space at any time, the **Manager** must either pass the manager role to another person who is capable of holding **Open Hours** or ask everyone to leave the space.  _At no time may people be in the space without an active **Manager** overseeing operations._

## Expelling people from the space ##

If the **Manager** feels that any person is acting in an unsafe or unrespectable way, the **Manager** may ask that person to leave.  Access to the space and its resources is contingent on the approval of the active **Manager**.

# Minors #

No minors under the age of 14 may use the space or its resources without the presence of a parent or legal guardian.

Minors between the ages of 14 and 18 must have a liability waiver signed by a parent or legal guardian in order to use the space or its resources.  The active **Manager** may choose to require that a supervisor or chaperone accompany the minor while accessing the space.  Such decision is fully at the discretion of the active **Manager**.  If the active **Manager** passes the manager role to another person, the new active **Manager** may change the requirement.

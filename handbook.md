# Open Hours #

**Open Hours** are times when the space is open to the public.  The **Manager** is responsible for the space and is in charge of keeping the space clean and safe.  The space should never be left open without an active **Manager**.

People should sign a liability waiver (application form) in order to use the space or its resources.  The **Manager** should check that the application form is on file.

## Manager  ##

Whoever unlocks and opens the door to the public is the **Manager**.  The **Manager** must ensure that users of the space have signed a liability waiver, help keep the space clean and safe, and oversee the general operations of the space.

If the **Manager** must leave the space at any time, the **Manager** must either pass the manager role to another person who is capable of holding **Open Hours** or ask everyone to leave the space.  _At no time may people be in the space without an active **Manager** overseeing operations._

## Expelling people from the space ##

If the **Manager** feels that any person is acting in an unsafe or unrespectable way, the **Manager** may ask that person to leave.  Access to the space and its resources is contingent on the approval of the active **Manager**.

# Minors #

No minors under the age of 14 may use the space or its resources without the presence of a parent or legal guardian.

Minors between the ages of 14 and 18 must have a liability waiver signed by a parent or legal guardian in order to use the space or its resources.  The active **Manager** may choose to require that a supervisor or chaperone accompany the minor while accessing the space.  Such decision is fully at the discretion of the active **Manager**.  If the active **Manager** passes the manager role to another person, the new active **Manager** may change the requirement.

# Donations #

## Small Donations ##

## Large Donations ##

## Donation Recycling ##

# Key Access #

A few different approaches for granting key access have already been proposed. Below is a short list of these ideas. If you have more ideas, please add them!

* *Sponsorship Model* - A system where existing key holding members would sponsor new key holders (and potentially take responsibility for any issues that might arise if a key-holdership went awry).

* *Fee Model* - Potential key holding members could make monetary donations to the space in effort to build trust and accountability. This was essentially the model we removed from our bylaws in June to help conform our our organization to needs of the State Non-Profit Application. Portions of this model to potentially be revived, as long as it is not creating an exclusive class of members, (i.e. creating a pay-to-play arrangement). If implemented in combination with other means of gaining key-holdership, we would probably still comply with the State requirements for non-profit status.

* *Volunteer Work Model* - Key-holdership could be granted if potential key-holders commit to volunteer tasks. Tasks might include: holding open hours, managing a donations program, maintaining a tools or materials database, or other such task.

* *Combination of Models* - Any of the above models could be combined to create a multi-pronged approach to key-holdership.

## Physical Keys ##

## Digital Keys ##

## Key Revocation ##

Our key-access policy should also include a means for revoking key access when needed. Some suggestions are included below. Please add more ideas if you have any!

* Discontinuation of regular donations
* Discontinuation of regular volunteer activities
* Significant violation of DMS rules or policies
* Voting
